import java.util.Arrays; // Purpose: Import the Arrays class. Explanation: This is used to sort the array of items.
import java.util.Comparator; // Purpose: Import the Comparator interface. Explanation: This is used to define custom sorting logic for items.

// Purpose: Class representing an item with a value and weight.
// Explanation: Each object of this class will store the value and weight of an item.
class Item {
    int value, weight; // Purpose: Store the value and weight of the item. Explanation: These fields hold the respective values for each item.

    // Purpose: Constructor to initialize the value and weight of the item.
    // Explanation: This constructor takes value and weight as parameters and assigns them to the fields of the class.
    public Item(int value, int weight) {
    	
//    	Purpose: Assigns the value passed as a parameter to the instance variable value of the object.
//    	Explanation: The this keyword refers to the current object. It distinguishes the instance variable value from the parameter value.
        this.value = value;
        
//        Purpose: Assigns the weight passed as a parameter to the instance variable weight of the object.
//        Explanation: Similarly, this.weight refers to the object's instance variable, ensuring it is set to the value provided when the object is created.
        this.weight = weight;
        
//        Why We Use the this Keyword:
//        	Purpose: The this keyword is used in Java to refer to the current object within a method or constructor.
//        	Explanation: When a method or constructor parameter has the same name as an instance variable, the this keyword is used to differentiate 
//        	between the two. It helps the compiler understand that you are referring to the instance variable of the object and not the local variable 
//        	or parameter.

//		### Explanation of Each Step:
//		
//		1. **Start**: Begin the execution of the program.
//		2. **Initialize Items Array and Knapsack Capacity**:
//		   - Define an array `items` with `Item` objects, each having a value and weight.
//		   - Set the `capacity` of the knapsack.
//		3. **Call `getMaxValue`**:
//		   - Begin the process of calculating the maximum value obtainable by calling `getMaxValue()` with the `items` array and `capacity`.
//		4. **Inside `getMaxValue`**:
//		   - **Sort Items**:
//		     - **Sort by Value-to-Weight Ratio**: Use a `Comparator` to sort items based on their value-to-weight ratio in descending order.
//		     - **Compare Items**: For each pair of items, compute the value-to-weight ratio and sort accordingly.
//		   - **Initialize `totalValue`**: Start with a total value of 0.0.
//		   - **Loop Through Sorted Items**:
//		     - **For Each Item**:
//		       - **Check if Item Can Fit Entirely**:
//		         - **If Yes**:
//		           - **Reduce Capacity**: Subtract the item's weight from the remaining knapsack capacity.
//		           - **Increase Total Value**: Add the item's value to `totalValue`.
//		         - **If No**:
//		           - **Calculate Fraction**: Determine how much of the item can fit based on the remaining capacity.
//		           - **Increase Total Value**: Add the fractional value of the item to `totalValue`.
//		           - **Break Loop**: Exit the loop since the knapsack is full.
//		5. **Return `totalValue`**: Return the calculated maximum value that can be obtained.
//		6. **Print Maximum Value Obtained**: Output the maximum value to the console.
//		7. **End**: Finish the execution of the program.
//		
//		This flowchart provides a clear visualization of how the Fractional Knapsack problem is solved using sorting based on value-to-weight ratios and then filling the knapsack in a greedy manner.
